                      Before programing I was in sales, specializing in Latin American territories. By analyzing and identifying potential risks in these territories I discovered my passion of problem solving. I was already in the tech field, however I was not involved in the the creation processes. Thus led me to Turing School of Software and Design.

                      Turing is a 7-month, in-person, intensive programming school. Throughout the program, I learned new programming languages, tools, and technologies quickly. Most of my programming experience is in Ruby on Rails, however I've also used Elxir, HTML/CSS, and Javascript.
